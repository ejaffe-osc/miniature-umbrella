The program aims to provide researchers with the skills, knowledge, and experience needed to leverage Jetstream2 in their AI-based research projects.&#160;The program will run from January to September 2025.</p><p><strong>Applications for the AI Fellows Program are currently closed; however, a second call will be announced in late spring 2025. Please check this page for the most up-to-date information.</strong></p></div></div><!-- /.layout --></div></div><div class="breakout collapsed bg-none section"><div class="row"><div class="layout"><div class="text"><h3>Project components</h3><p>There are four components to the program:</p><ul><li><strong>Project Consulting.</strong> The program will provide consultation for the fellows to help them overcome technical or logistical challenges they may encounter in their AI-based research projects on Jetstream2, including onboarding onto the systems and taking advantage of the advanced capabilities of the cutting-edge GPU resources on Jetstream2.</li><li><strong>Training.</strong> Jetstream2 AI Workbench and other training to augment your AI techniques.</li><li><strong>Priority Access to High-End GPUs.</strong> Jetstream2 makes available 90 GPU-enabled nodes with four <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/a100/">NVIDIA A100 GPUs</a> each and will be expanded to include NVIDIA H100 GPUs in the near future. Fellows will enjoy priority access to the Jetstream2 GPU resources to achieve their project goals and accelerate their science.</li><li><strong>Community Contribution.</strong> One goal of the program is to enable other researchers to benefit from the lessons learned during the program. Fellows will work with the Jetstream2 team to identify a relevant target for maximum impact.</li></ul></div><h3>Program details</h3><div class="accordion" data-accordion="" id="accordion-0--1730175065"><div class="accordion-item"><h3><button aria-controls="panel-0--1730175065-1" class="accordion-title" id="panel-0--1730175065-1-heading"><span class="accordion-label has-content">Eligibility</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="accordion-icon"></span></button></h3></div><div aria-labelledby="panel-0--1730175065-1-heading" class="accordion-content" data-tab-content="" id="panel-0--1730175065-1" role="region"><p>The program will accept fellows who meet the following eligibility criteria:</p><ul><li><a href="https://nairrpilot.org/opportunities/allocations">NAIRR-pilot</a> PI eligible researchers (US-based researchers and educators from US-based institutions who are working in the US).</li><li>Graduate students are eligible to apply but must include a letter of collaboration from their graduate advisor (see application info below).</li></ul></div><div class="accordion-item"><h3><button aria-controls="panel-0--1730175065-2" class="accordion-title" id="panel-0--1730175065-2-heading"><span class="accordion-label has-content">Selection</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="accordion-icon"></span></button></h3></div><div aria-labelledby="panel-0--1730175065-2-heading" class="accordion-content" data-tab-content="" id="panel-0--1730175065-2" role="region"><ul><li>Applications will be reviewed by the Jetstream2 project team.</li><li>Selection criteria will be focused on:
