# Hugo Conversion

This repository contains the original Jetstream2 HTML files and a new `site/` directory with a Hugo implementation.

## Building the site

1. Ensure [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is installed.
2. Run:

```bash
cd site
hugo --minify
```

The generated site will appear in `site/public`.
